# /speckit.plan

Generate an implementation plan from the PRD.

## Usage

Use this command to create a high-level implementation plan based on the project requirements document (PRD).

## Description

The `/speckit.plan` command analyzes the PRD and generates a structured implementation plan that breaks down the project into major phases and components.

## Example

```
/speckit.plan
```

This will generate a plan that includes:
- Setup & Configuration
- Core Features
- Styling & UI
- Testing & Validation
- Finalization

## Next Steps

After generating a plan, use `/speckit.tasks` to break the plan down into specific, actionable tasks.
